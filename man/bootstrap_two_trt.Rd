\usage{
bootstrap_two_trt(
  pilot,
  category_col = NULL,
  n_boots = 5000,
  n_eff_size_bins = 40,
  min_exp_n = 40,
  seed = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pilot}{species-by-site matrix from a pilot biodiversity survey with two treatments, in which the first column lists site names or codes, the second lists the site category or treatment, and all following columns are named with species names and contain binary (0-1) values. See `data("pilot_two_trts")` for an example.}

\item{category_col}{the column name in `pilot` that specifies the treatment of sampling sites.}

\item{n_boots}{The number of simulated community pairs to bootstrap, which will be compared to each other for differences in species richness. Increasing the number of bootstrapped communities should result in more effect sizes (differences in richness between simulated pairs) qualifying for the power analysis (a histogram of richness differences from `n_boots` communities will be sorted into `n_eff_size_bins`, and bins that surpass the `min_exp_n` threshold will be retained for following steps).}

\item{n_eff_size_bins}{n_eff_size_bins The total number of bins to separate the histogram of  richness differences detected between simulated communities. Increasing `n_eff_size_bins` can offer higher resolution in the following steps (more bins to qualify), but can result in "toothy" histograms in which sequential bins are not all filled. Decreasing `n_eff_size_bins` should fix "toothiness".}

\item{min_exp_n}{The threshold number of simulated pairs to qualify a given effect size bin for retention. Higher `min_exp_n` values will offer greater resolution in following steps, but will decrease the number of effect sizes that qualify.}

\item{seed}{Random seed. Defaults to 1 so runs of the same data will provide the same answers, but since the simulations all rely on random draws, changing the seed will result in different answers.}
}
\value{
a tibble of `min_exp_n` simulated communities, rarified to equal coverage, within all effect size bins that qualify. Additionally, prints a histogram of simulated community richness values, highlighting the bins that are kept for the next step.
}
\description{
`bootstrap_two_trt` creates `n_boots` simulated communities from a pilot biodiversity survey, pulled from randomly drawn sites from the `pilot` survey, with replacement. Bootstrapped pairs are compared for differences in richness, and differences in richness (log2 ratio) are sorted into a histogram with `n_eff_size_bins` bins. When possible, `min_exp_n` experiments (pairs of simulated communities, rarefied to equal sample coverage) are retained and kept as the input for the following function.

\usage{
subsample_boots(
  boots,
  pilot,
  method = "single",
  power = c(80),
  target_eff_size = NULL,
  cost_per_sample = NULL,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pilot}{original pilot study. Identical to the pilot input in `bootstrap_single_trt`}

\item{power}{statistical power with which the user wants to detect richness change (defaults to 80)}

\item{target_eff_size}{if supplied, the level of richness change the user wants to detect (in log2 ratio units).}

\item{cost_per_sample}{cost per unit sample (linear only), which will add an axis to output plots for total cost per unit power.}

\item{seed}{random seed. Defaults to 1 so repeat runs will be identical, but since simulations rely on random draws, changing the seed will result in different answers.}

\item{data}{tibble of bootstrapped communities across multiple effect sizes. Output from `bootstrap_single_trt`.}
}
\value{
list of plots.
}
\description{
Downsample bootstrapped communities to lower sample sizes representing a gradient of coverage values, and assess the proportion of correct-direction detections within each coverage interval.
